    <p><b>An indulgent cheesecake with no cooking required</b></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>200g digestive biscuits</li>
    <li>75g unsalted butter</li>
    <li>400g full-fat cream cheese at room temperature</li>
    <li>300g mascarpone at room temperature</li>
    <li>200g icing sugar, sifted</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>100g malted milk balls</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>steps</i></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place the digestive biscuits into a sealable freezer bag. Push all the air out and seal the bag. Crush the biscuits with a rolling pin, being careful not to break any holes in the bag.</li>
    <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Tip the biscuit crumbs into the butter and mix well until thoroughly combined. Press the buttery crumbs into the bottom of a 23cm/9in springform or loose-bottomed tin. Chill in the refrigerator while you make the topping.</li>
    <li>Combine the cream cheese and mascarpone in a large mixing bowl. Using an electric handheld mixer, blend the cheeses together until light and fluffy. Add the icing sugar a little at a time and blend to incorporate. Finally, mix in the vanilla. The mixture should be very light and fluffy. </li>
<li>Place the malted milk balls in the sealable freezer bag and close. Knock the malted milk balls with a rolling pin to just break them apart. Fold half of the crushed malted milk balls into the cream cheese mixture until thoroughly combined.</li>
<li>Spread the cream cheese mixture over the biscuit base and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for at least four hours. </li>
<li>When ready to serve, sprinkle the remaining crushed malted milk balls over the top of the cheesecake. Release the catch of the springform tin carefully, then slice and serve.</li>
